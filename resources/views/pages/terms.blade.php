			<p>All bookings are made subject to both Minibus And Taxi Transfers terms below and the specific booking conditions of your relevant Travel Supplier It is your responsibility to ensure that you have read, understood and agree both prior to booking. If you would like to contact us in writing please send your request to the following address: Minibus &amp; Taxi Transfers, HQ Hamill, Clippers Quay, Salford Quays, M50 3XP</p>
			<span>Delays to Service</span>
			<p>No responsibility or liability whatsoever can be accepted by Minibus And Taxi Transfers for traffic congestion, road accidents, adverse weather conditions or other matters outside its reasonable control which may cause delay. Both parties expressly recognise in transport such as coach hire that buses can be late as a normal cause of business without negligence on behalf of the coach hire company (typically due to previous customer delays, traffic, accidents and mechanical problems).
			If any driver is delayed by more than 60 minutes with one of our coaches getting to the passengers and we are unable to replace a delayed coach within 1 hour and 30 minutes and the client chooses to make their own alternative travel arrangements they may be entitled to a refund of the deposit paid to Minibus And Taxi Transfers only. If for any reason the driver has to re-route the journey due to traffic, adverse weather conditions or any unforeseen reasons and cannot get the passengers to the destination on time, neither the driver or Minibus And Taxi Transfers will be held liable for any loss incurred for eg missed flights, paying extra for alternative transport, missed events or lateness to meetings etc. Also if the vehicle allocated to the journey has a mechanical issue prior to the journey or on the journey and we cannot find an alternative vehicle, Minibus And Taxi Transfers will not be held liable for any loss incurred and will not pay out any compensation under any circumstance; at managements discretion they may allow the deposit to be refunded.</p>
			<span>Cancellation Policy &amp; Refund Policy</span>
			<p>If a booking is cancelled in writing by the Customer with more than 5 days left before the date of travel, other than the initial deposit paid by the Customer, the Customer will have no further costs to pay. If a booking is cancelled by the Customer with less than 5 days’ notice, payment in full will be due to Minibus And Taxi Transfers from the Customer.
			Deposits are non refundable on bookings cancelled by the Customer. We are however prepared to roll over deposits onto alternative trips at the time of cancellation.</p>
			<span>Damages / Spillage</span>
			<p>Any damage/spillage caused by the passengers will be charged accordingly by the driver at a minimum rate of £25 this also includes soft drinks water wine spirits or any form of liquid.</p>
			<p>Any fines for misuse, damage or spillages have to be paid in cash to the driver.Drinking is not permitted unless it has been agreed prior to booking; also it MAY be allowed at drivers discretion but only if driver has agreed for passengers to do so.</p>
			<span>Extra drop offs / re route / extra hours</span>
			<p>Any extra drop offs which are not included on the initial booking will be charged at a minimum of £10-25 per drop at the drivers discretion, any amount charged will have to be paid in cash to the driver. If for any reason the customer requires extra stay by the driver, if the driver can accommodate their requirements, they have to pay £50 per hour minimum charge and an hourly rate of £50 thereafter.</p>
