      <p>Some parties are much larger than even a full size van can hold. There is no need to separate a large group into several carpools that must be fed with multiple engines. Petrol is costly enough, and a single motor coach is more fuel efficient than several vans. It is also so much easier to keep everyone together and accounted for when all heads can be counted from the front.</p>
      <p>Minibus Hire London offers services in Manchester as well. The fleet is much larger than just minibuses, and a full length coach is more versatile and much more impressive when pulling in front of a group. A business does not need to own their own fleet, especially whenever an event is onetime or limited to a few times a year.</p>

      <p>Coaches and double deck buses are superior to vans because they are designed for long distance travel. The engines are much more robust, and there is compartment space both in the lockers below deck and in overhead cabin storage. This arrangement is convenient, both because passengers can tow along large bags and because it separates luggage for safety and security.</p>
