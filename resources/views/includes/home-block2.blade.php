        <p>Leeds offers a number of attractions that can keep you hooked for hours, or days on end. The Royal Armouries have thousands of items that will capture your interest the whole day. If this isn’t enough, you can head out to the Georgian Mansion in Harewood to experience the stunning gardens and well-manicured grounds. You can also decide to have a glimpse into the history of medicine at the Thackray Museum. All these attractions are fun if you move in a group because you will be able to discuss and take memorable pictures. So, how can you move around Leeds as a group conveniently? The answer is one – use our minibus hire services.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>A minibus tour is a practical and affordable way to go around in a group, especially if you have luggage. A minibus provides enough storage space to keep the luggage and leaves enough room for you and your colleagues to travel in comfort.</b></p>
